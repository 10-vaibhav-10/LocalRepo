    Hey There, This is repo created in local pc
    and then we used "git init" to first connect the 
    folder(repo) with the github. <br>
    Now we are ready to add and commit both the
    folder and file to our remote(cloud) repo.
    
    <p><H3>Branch separated= Feature 1</H3><br>
        WE create a branch named "Feature1" by
        1 => git checkout -b "branch name"<br>
        
        We now switch it to newly created branch
        2=> git checkout "branch name"<br>

        We delete it => git branch -d "branch name"

        # And if we want to check which branch we are we need to
        => git branch

        # To rename the branch
        => git branch -m main ( To rename branch )

    </p>
